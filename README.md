# Allstar Bootcamp
Portfolio Project 1 - Code Institute - Update Version

After completing my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institue I decided te revisit this project and update some of the styling. If you would like to see my original project which was submitted as part of my diploma please click [here](https://github.com/Lucy-Glanville-Brown/allstar-bootcamp)

This is a website for a Fitness Bootcamp in West Sussex. I am passionate about bootcamp style fitness having attended many sessions over the years and being impressed by what you can achieve when encouraged by others within a group.  I want the Allstar Fitness site to encourage users of the site to feel inspired to try a session and share the experience.
Information in the pages should portray the feeling of the team spirit and comradery within the group. There is a timetable of the days and times of the sessions, plus examples of the equipment and exercises that could be used.  There is also a contact page where the user can sign up and see a map of the location.  
The target audience would be people of all ages and abilities that are interested in group fitness in the local area.

## UX
### User Stories
As a user I would expect to see information about the bootcamp including times, place and contact information.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to include minimalist but useful information with eye catching images. This website is aimed to attract all demographics with an interest in attending a group based fitness bootcamp.

### Scope
For the users I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of what the bootcamp does on the homepage with the option to find out more by clicking on the links to the other pages.

### Structure
I wanted the homepage to be eye catching with a brief introduction to what the bootcamp is all about with the option to find out more by visiting the other pages. The navigation is clear to see and easy to use.

### Skeleton
The wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

#### Homepage

#### Timetable

#### More Info

#### Contact Us

### Surface
#### Images
Each of the images used have similar colours and if there was more than one image on a page I tried to keep the colours the same. I wanted some of the images to show the team work and comradery between the participants.

#### Colours
The colour chosen for the hero-text, timetable and sign-up form backgrounds was chosen using https://coolors.co/. I wanted a colour that would stand out but wouldn't look out of place against the hero image.

#### Typography
I decided to use “Josefin Sans” and “San-serif” for the main body text with “Raleway” and “Sans-Serif” for the headings. These were found by exploring Google Fonts.

To create the timetable grid container I researched how to do this on W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid_container.asp

I also used display: flex in some of the css styling which I looked up on W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp and also found this useful flexbox cheat sheet https://jonitrythall.com/content/flexboxsheet.pdf
